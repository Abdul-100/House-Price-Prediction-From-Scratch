# House Price Prediction (Linear Regression from Scratch)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression** model without using high-level libraries like Scikit-Learn. The goal was to understand the mathematical foundations of Machine Learning, specifically **Gradient Descent** and **Loss Optimization**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy (for vectorization and math operations)
* **Concepts:** Gradient Descent, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Forward Propagation

## 🧠 Key Learnings
* Implemented the equation $y = wx + b$ manually using NumPy arrays.
* Built a custom training loop to optimize weights and biases.
* Visualized how the **Loss Function** decreases over training epochs.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2.  Run the cells sequentially to see the model train and predict.
